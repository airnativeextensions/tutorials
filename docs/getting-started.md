These tutorials will cover adding a Native Extension for Adobe AIR to your application.

We are going to be focusing on the native extensions developed by distriqt, but these guides should apply to any native extension (ANE).

Native Extensions for Adobe AIR are code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an ActionScript API. Native extensions provide easy access to device-specific libraries and features that are not available in the built-in ActionScript classes.

Their usage is similar to a SWC package of precompiled Flash symbols and code.

In the following tutorial we are going to go through the process of adding an ANE to your AIR application using some of the most common AIR development tools. We assume you already understand the process of developing and deploying mobile applications using AIR so will just be concentrating on the additional steps required to get an ANE working.
